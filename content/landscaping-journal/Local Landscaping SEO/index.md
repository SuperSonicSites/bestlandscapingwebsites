Would you like to be the first name that pops up when someone is looking for a landscaper in your area? If so, you are in the right place.

When you type in "Landscapers near me" what are you getting? If you are not right at the top, you can bet that you are not getting the amount of leads that you should. Not just a little bit, **a truck load of leads going to your competitors**. 

It's not that it's crazy complicated to get that spot, but you have to know the game...and play it. Most don't and this is where the opportunity is.

## What's the game and how do you play it?

I could bore you with all the technical details, but let's keep it simple. 
1. Get a [Google My Business listing](https://business.google.com/)
2. Have a consistent presence
3. Get every single customer to leave you a review on Google

**That's it!**

Now of course, the devil is in the detail. So let me tease it out a bit:

### 1. Consistent Presence
In local SEO, it is called the **NAP**, which stands for **N**ame, **A**ddress, **P**hone Number. 

You would be surprised how many people have a different name for their businesses in different places. Just for fun, look at your business on [Yelp](https://business.yelp.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com). 

8/10 businesses have either a different name, phone number and address across just those three.

Why should you care? 

Well, Google wants to determine if you are a real business. A real business has a brand name, a phone number, and an address. If it's all mixed up, it doesn't inspire confidence in Google, and they won't refer you.

### 2. Get As Many Reviews As Humanly Possible

Google doesn't just want to see that you have just a few five-star reviews. It wants new and fresh reviews constantly. It's also good for your potential customers. A one-year-old review isn't as good as a review from someone yesterday.

So how should you go about getting reviews? Most people do it wrong. (Don't be like most people)

Ideally, you need to get a review from your client before you leave the job site. 

#### A simple script:

- **You**: So, how happy are you with our work?
- **Them**: Fantastic! I'm super happy with the results.
- **You**: That's great to hear! Can I ask you for a quick favor?
- **Them**: Sure, what is it?
- **You**: We get most of our business from Google, and a review would mean the world to us. Here, just scan this QR code with your phone, and it will take you directly to the review page.
- **Them**: Absolutely. Give me a moment.

People are happy to leave a review if you make it easy. If you wait until you are gone, the next best thing (not as good for sure) is through a SMS message as you leave the driveway. The longer you wait, the less likely they are to leave a review. You have one shot at this, take it.

## That's it? Almost...
If you have a consistent presence across the web and get every happy client to leave you a review, you are in the top 5% of landscapers. With consistency and time, you will start ranking higher than your competitors…guaranteed.

Now, to add some gravy on top and accelerate the results, post all your new project pictures on your Google My Business profile and treat it as if it were Social Media. Also, answer your reviews!

## Conclusion

There is much more to making your landscaping website the best it can be. But the above will put you in a different category, bringing you more eyeballs and clients than your competition.

To your continued success.

Cheers!
