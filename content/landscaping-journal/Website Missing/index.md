You have a landscaping website and feel like it's not doing as good of a job as it should? If that's the case, you are in the right place. 
The goal of this article is to give you clear steps to improve your landscaping website and stand above the competition. The following content is the distillation of decades of experience and our team surveying hundreds of landscaping websites over the years. We know what works and what doesn't.

Go through these 5 things and let us know if you've actually hit all of those points already. We would love to take a look at your website and maybe feature it on our next blog. ðŸ˜€

**Note:** We are not expecting you to implement the strategies below on your own, ideally, you have a good web person on your team who would implement those strategies. You have a business to run after all!

## #1- Your Website Needs More Pages...A LOT More.

The more pages your website has, the more your website will be found on Google. 

**Period.** 

Below is an image of what happened when we took the website through steps of adding pages. 

![Graph showing the increase in traffic when more pages are added to a landscaping website](more_pages_more_eyeballs.jpg "More Pages More Eyeballs")

The flat line is when the website has 5 pages (home, about, services, testimonials and contact).

The first bump is when we added a page for each services. The last bump on the right is when we added locations pages.

You would be surprised how many of the landscaper website we have looked at only have 4 or 5 pages. 

If you just got started, it might just be want you need. But if you are looking to get serious traction with it, you need more pages.

### Start With Service Pages

You offer more than a single service? Good! Why not have a page for each where you show your prices, have an Frequently Asked Questions, show service specific testimonials and show off your masterpieces? Those pages can serve in two ways. One, they will give more in-depth information to your prospects and second, they can rank in your local market for your prospects.

### Then Have Locations Pages

Do you have a page for each location you are serving? If not, you are missing out on a huge opportunity. When people go into google, how do you think they start their search? What do you think they type?

They type in something like "landcsaper in {Location}" like "Landscaping company in Toronto" or "Toronto Landscaper". If you do not have a page people can land on which specifically speak to that market, it's a big missed opportunity.

**Bonus Tips**: Have each location page have links to your services. Google will love you for it.

### Finally, Build Your Portfolio

This is where so many drop the ball. You build an amazing deck or patio, you transformed a yard...and your website isn't show and tell about your amazing service. Not only that, from a "getting more eyeballs" perspective, your portfolio can bolster all of your other pages. If you have a good web designer by your side, he will make it so that each services will display the portfolio pages related to the services, that the location pages display portfolio from that location and finally that the portfolio page boosts the ranking of your service pages AND location page.

Here is a graph to help seeing the relationships between pages.

Not only will it make your website more appealing, **Google will love you for it.** The more portfolio pages you produce, the more your other pages will start ranking. 

#### Do you have time for this?

You are busy, you have a team to run, estimates and quotes to ship...Keep it simple stupid. Make an arrangement with your developer that you'll be sending 2 pictures (before and after), the list of services that was involved and if there is a testimonial, include it. He/She should take care of the rest and make sure that the services and location are linked together. That's what you are paying them for...right?

## #2- Make An Offer

"Get A Free Quote"...that's it? Who charges for a quote anyway?!

You can do better. Since bascically 95% landscapers only offer a "Free Quote", you might as well stand out by actually making a compelling offer. 

It could be as simple as "The Three Cuts Are On Us!" or "Early Birds Get 15% OFF" or "Every jobs over $5000 gets a $500 Discount" or "Pay For The Year And Get One Month Of Free Service"...you get the idea. You can do better than "Free Quote".

When we build websites for clients, we like to create special landing pages with specific offers that they can leverage by sending postcards or running facebook ads in their local market. Ask you developer to at least create one so you can start testing.

## #3- Testimonials, Testimonials, Testimonials

Social proof is very important and testimonials is the name of the game when it comes to getting clients. You should have a system to make extra sure that every satisfied customer leaves a review. Don't leave it to them. Have a card with a QR code they can scan right in front of you so that they are redirected to your Google My Business Page. The velocity of your reviews (and your response to them) will make you climb the local search rankings.

Not only that, your developer can add a widget that displays all of your 5 Star reviews as they come in. When your potential clients sees a wall of testimonials of satisfied customers, they will for sure feel more comfortable reaching out. 

## Conclusion

There is a lot more to make your landscaping website the best landscaping website you can get. But the above will for sure put you in a different category, get your more eyeballs and more clients than your competition if they are not already there.
