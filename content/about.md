## Trade Secrets For Landscapers Only

Howdy!

I'm Renaud Gagn√©, the CTO and Co-Founder of Supersonic Sites. Our team has been building websites for over a decade, and we have decided to launch "Best Landscaping Websites" by [Supersonic](https://www.supersonicsites.com). 

Each niche is different and has it's own kirks. 99% of web designers are generalists. They will do their best base on their general knowledge. But to get results above average, you need specialized knowledge.

We are building a growth toolkit, working closely with our current clients who are landscaping business owners. This blog documents our findings and what we have seen work and not work.

Why did we move away from the marketing agency model? Well, because the model is fundamentally broken. 

Either:

- **A.** You hire an agency, and they suck. You waste time and money.
- **B.** You hire an agency, and they are amazing. Bad news: they now OWN your marketing and client acquisition. You can't live without them.

There is a better way. A way in which we build the best landscaping website money can buy and give you all the tools and means to generate your leads with it. If the website piece is done right, all you need to know is how to run ads using postcards, Facebook/Instagram Ads, etc. We'll even provide the templates and the courses on how to do it. *It's a lot easier then peeople think.*

Is it ready yet? Nope. But we'll share the results of our testing and experiment as we go. Whether or not you decide to let us build your website, we are here to share the secret sauce with you.
